My name is Alex Wilkinson and I am passionate about eyebrows. I am fully qualified from the High Definition Group, which is the official brand of HD Brows, who are the experts in brows.

My aim is to offer a professional, easy-to-access, creative eyebrow experience to all my clients. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6bac7aec-6e78-4032-b5fe-baa3ccc3476c.png)

The Process: 

1\. Contact me for an appointment or information

2\. I send you a patch test in the post, next day delivery, this must be applied 24 hours before you appointment. 

3\. You attend your appointment and leave with amazing eyebrows

All very easy - no more attending a salon 2 days before your appointment to have a patch test, I simply send it to you.

TOTALLY TAILORED TO YOU I will begin with an in-depth consultation to discuss size, shape and the look you want before beginning work on your bespoke brows. Custom-blended colour is applied and whether we darken, lighten\* or simply tone the natural colour of your brow hair, I will ensure your new brows complement your look, and your style. 

From there, I use our exclusive brow mapping formula to design your unique shape before using a combination of HD hair removal techniques to create it. Finally your brows will be perfected using our luxury make up collection -- you'll be given a mini make up lesson to help you maintain and make the most of your brows between appointments. And don't worry if there isn't enough hair to create your perfect arch immediately, I will put you on a regrowth programme and work with you every step of the way to achieve the perfect brow for you.

FAQ's - How long does the treatment take? This isn't just a brow shape -- this is an experience which usually takes between 30-45 minutes.

How long does the treatment last? The effects of the treatment regularly last between 4-6 weeks, however this can vary depending on your hair growth. You'll soon discover with your HD Brows Stylist how often you should be repeating the treatment

My brows are over-plucked and sparse -- can I still get HD Brows? Hope is not lost! I will work with you on a re-growth programme to achieve the perfect brow shape for you. In the meantime, you can 'fake it to make it' with a little make up application, demonstrated by me at your appointment. Use our Lash&Brow Booster to encourage and improve hair growth.
